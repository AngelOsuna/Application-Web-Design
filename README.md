## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plain text documents. It’s commonly used for creating README files, writing messages in online discussion forums, and crafting rich text using a plain text editor. Markdown allows you to structure your text using headers, lists, links, and more, without complicated formatting.
